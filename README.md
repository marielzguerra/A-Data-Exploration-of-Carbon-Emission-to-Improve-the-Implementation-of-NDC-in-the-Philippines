**Introduction**

We are now living in a critical era where we literally have two options left: DO or DIE. Climate change is occurring in a very obvious manner where the impact is clearly visible to our naked eyes. Recently, the world was shocked when a group of NASA scientists commits civil disobedience shouting to stop burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and water vapor are the known grenehouse gasses that keep the balance of energy in the planet. However, this greenhouse gasses became imbalance. According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (2022), carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that was emitted through human activities and it enters the atmosphere through burning fossils fuels and other biological materials. Greenhouse gasses traps the heat in the atmosphere causing to the global temperature to rise.. Carbon dioxide has the highest amount of emission in the atmosphere, according to Osmanski (2020), and it is a threat to our world. Carbon dioxide is abundant, which leads to global warming and climate change. 

National Determined Contribution (NDC), according to United Nations Climate Change (2022), is the heart of Paris Agreement and is the implementation plan of each country to reduce the greenhouse gas emission and response to the climate change. As part of Paris Agreement, Philipines submitted it's revised NDC under the administration of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. But the said NDC has lack of transparency on how it will be implemented and achieved it's goal. In order to help to improve the implementation of NDC in the Philippines, the researchers conducted an analysis of carbon emission of each country and determined which has the lowest carbon emission and assess their mitigation plan. The information that will be gathered might help the Philippines to effectively implement the NDC. 
This project is conducted to provide a data analysis that could help to improve the mitigation plan in response to climate change that can be implemented in the Philippines and helps to achieve the NDC. 


**Problem Statement**

The revised NDC of the Philippines lacks of clear policies on it's goal to achieve a reduction of emission to 75% by the year 2030. According to Greenpeace Philippines (2021), the draft didn't discussed transparent policies on how it will be implemented in the sectors of agriculture, waste, transportation, industry and energy. Implementation of NDC is the government's repsonsibility as part of taking adoptation plan in climate change, but NDC quite needs a high level of participation which is notvisible to its citizens. The cooperation of the key agencies of each sectors needs urgency to back up the Philippine government in achieving the goal and also the participation of each individual is necessary. 

**Significance of the proposed project**

This research will specifically benefit the following:

Government - This research will help them to improve their implementation of mitigation plans for climate change, and make the local communities and individuals participate in the program and achieve the goal.  

Citizens - This research provides information to the Filipino citizens about the current situation of the globe and the country itself concerning greenhouse gas emission that results in climate change. For them to be aware and well informed on how they could contribute and cooperate to the government to achieve the goal.

Future Researchers – The findings of this study may be utilized to help the future researchers in their future studies in relation to climate change and come up with an ideal mitigation plan for climate change that they may propose to their local community.

**Methods**

Local communities cooperation is a crucial aspect of the implementation of NDC. Data exploration will be conducted by the researcher to visualize the data and easily identify the insight of other countries' response to climate change and dig deeper into their mitigation plan to achieve the neutral greenhouse gas emission in their country. Excluded in the datasets that the researchers have, was the details of the mitigation plan of each country. In order to acquire more knowledge about how they manage to have a positive response in carbon and other green  emission, the researchers collected articles that provide adequate information about their mitigation strategies. Their plan will be evaluated and the existing mitigation strategies that the Philippine Government have implemented across the country will be compared in order to determine how to improve it.

**Expected Output**

According to NOAA experts,2020 is the warmest year on record, tying 2016 for top place with 2019 falling to third. This study aims to give a thorough examination of data that may be used to improve the country's NDC implementation. Good and efficient climate change governance is required for effective collaboration to attain the specified goals. The governance structure must also contain a clear division of tasks to reduce duplication of effort between the government and civil society.

**Sustainable Development Goals**
1. GOAL 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY - Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity.
