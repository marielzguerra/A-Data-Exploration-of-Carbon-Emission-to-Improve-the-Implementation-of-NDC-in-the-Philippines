## **A Data Exploration of Greenhouse Gas Emission to Improve the Implementation of NDC in the Philippines**

**Introduction**

Climate change is happening right now, and it is considered as the biggest environmental problem that today's generation has ever faced. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) explains how climate change has thoroughly changed the Earth for the past centuries. Global warming is unmistakably the product of human activities since the mid-twentieth century, and it is occurring at an unprecedented rate spanning millennia. It is
undeniable that human activities contributed to warming the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred. Since the late 90s, the average surface temperature of the planet has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1C°), causing increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. During the last 40 years, the majority of the temperature rise has occurred with the last seven years being the warmest. The hottest years on record are 2016 and 2020.

Though carbon dioxide absorbs less heat per molecule compared to other greenhouse gasses, it is the most abundant and stays longer in the atmosphere. It stays 300 to 100 years in the
atmosphere, and each year, we emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more than what the natural process could remove.  Increasing atmospheric gas causes an energy imbalance that contributes to the rise of the Earth’s temperature. Carbon emissions have a direct impact on humans, with increased smog and air pollution causing greater respiratory problems or diseases. Not to mention the fact that if carbon emissions wipe out particular animal species, disrupt crop production, and devastate lands, people will suffer the consequences.

Philippines, despite being one of those countries who contributes less on carbon emission, implements a mitigation plan as response to climate change. Recently,  President Rodrigo R. Duterte has approved the Philippines' first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 75% by 2030, the Finance department stated. Though the country's ability to achieve the target of NDC still depends on the cooperation of public and private sectors.

This project is conducted to provide a data analysLocal communities cooperation is a crucial aspect of the implementation of NDC. Data exploration will be conducted by the researcher to visualize the data and easily identify the insight of other countries' response to climate change and dig deeper into their mitigation plan to achieve the neutral greenhouse gas emission in their country. Excluded in the datasets that the researchers have, was the details of the mitigation plan of each country. In order to acquire more knowledge about how they manage to have a positive response in carbon emission, the researchers collected articles that provide adequate information about their mitigation strategies. Those countries who have achieved the net-zero emission that was shown in the dataset will be listed along with their strategies. Their plan will be evaluated and the existing mitigation strategies that the Philippine Government have implemented across the country will be compared in order to determine how to improve it.is that could help to improve the mitigation plan in response to climate change that can be implemented in the Philippines and helps to achieve the NDC.


**Problem Statement**

While the goal of the NDC seems to be too ambitious, it can’t be done by the government alone. A huge effort from public or private enterprises is needed as well as the local government and most specially each citizen of the country. It takes all individuals to make the changes possible. The primary issue that this project addressed is the low level of participation and involvement of  the local communities and local governments, due to lack of available and sufficient information on the implementation process and measures aimed at achieving it. Monitoring progress becomes much more difficult due to the absence of information. If there is a lack of civil society participation, it can hinder transparency and accountability efforts by government and related monitoring mechanisms at all levels. 


**Significance of the Proposed Project**

This research will specifically benefit the following:
      
Government - This research will help them to improve their implementation of mitigation plans for climate change, and make the local communities and individuals participate in the program and achieve the goal.  

Citizens - This research provides information to the Filipino citizens about the current situation of the globe and the country itself concerning greenhouse gas emission that results in climate change. For them to be aware and well informed on how they could contribute and cooperate to the government to achieve the goal.

Future Researchers – The findings of this study may be utilized to help the future researchers in their future studies in relation to climate change and come up with an ideal mitigation plan for climate change that they may propose to their local community.

**Methods**

Local communities cooperation is a crucial aspect of the implementation of NDC. Data exploration will be conducted by the researcher to visualize the data and easily identify the insight of other countries' response to climate change and dig deeper into their mitigation plan to achieve the neutral greenhouse gas emission in their country. Excluded in the datasets that the researchers have, was the details of the mitigation plan of each country. In order to acquire more knowledge about how they manage to have a positive response in carbon emission, the researchers collected articles that provide adequate information about their mitigation strategies. Those countries who have achieved the net-zero emission that was shown in the dataset will be listed along with their strategies. Their plan will be evaluated and the existing mitigation strategies that the Philippine Government have implemented across the country will be compared in order to determine how to improve it.

**Expected Output**

2020 ranks as the second-hottest year on record for the planet, knocking 2019 down to third hottest, according to an analysis by NOAA scientists. NASA scientists, who conducted a separate but similar analysis, have determined that 2020 ties 2016 as the warmest year on record, sharing the first-place spot (NOAA, 2021). This research is conducted to provide an efficient exploratory of data to be utilized in order to improve the implementation of NDC in the country. Effective cooperation to meet the goals established requires good and efficient climate change governance. To minimize duplication of effort between the government and civil society, the governance system must also include a transparent distribution of tasks.

**Sustainable Development Goals**
1. GOAL 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY - Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity.
2. GOAL 12: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION - Responsible Production and Consumption
3. GOAL 13: CLIMATE ACTION - Climate change is a global challenge that affects everyone, everywhere.
4. GOAL 15: LIFE ON LAND - Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss
