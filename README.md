## **A Data Exploration of Carbon Emission to Improve the Implementation of NDC in the Philippines**

**Introduction**

Climate change is happening right now, and it is considered as the biggest environmental problem that today's generation has ever faced. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) explains how climate change has thoroughly changed the Earth for the past centuries. Global warming is unmistakably the product of human activities since the mid-twentieth century, and it is occurring at an unprecedented rate spanning millennia. It is
undeniable that human activities contributed to warming the atmosphere, ocean, and land and that widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred. Since the late 90s, the average surface temperature of the planet has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1C°), causing increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. During the last 40 years, the majority of the temperature rise has occurred with the last seven years being the warmest. The hottest years on record are 2016 and 2020.

Though carbon dioxide absorbs less heat per molecule compared to other greenhouse gasses, it is the most abundant and stays longer in the atmosphere. It stays 300 to 100 years in the
atmosphere, and each year, we emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more than what the natural process could remove.  Increasing atmospheric gas causes an energy imbalance that contributes to the rise of the Earth’s temperature. Carbon emissions have a direct impact on humans, with increased smog and air pollution causing greater respiratory problems or diseases. Not to mention the fact that if carbon emissions wipe out particular animal species, disrupt crop production, and devastate lands, people will suffer the consequences.

Philippines, despite being one of those countries who contributes less on carbon emission, implements a mitigation plan as response to climate change. Recently,  President Rodrigo R. Duterte has approved the Philippines' first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) which aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 75% by 2030, the Finance department stated. Though the country's ability to achieve the target of NDC still depends on the cooperation of public and private sectors.

This project is conducted to provide a data analysis that could help to improve the mitigation plan in response to climate change that can be implemented in the Philippines and helps to achieve the NDC.


**Problem Statement**

**Significance of the Proposed Project**

This research will specifically benefit the following:
         Government - This research will help them to improve their implementation of mitigation plans for climate change, and make the local communities and individuals participate in the program and achieve the goal.  

         Citizens - This research provides information to the Filipino citizens about the current situation of the globe and the country itself concerning greenhouse gas emission that results in climate change. For them to be aware and well informed on how they could contribute and cooperate to the government to achieve the goal.

          Future Researchers – The findings of this study may be utilized to help the future researchers in their future studies in relation to climate change and come up with an ideal mitigation plan for climate change that they may propose to their local community.
