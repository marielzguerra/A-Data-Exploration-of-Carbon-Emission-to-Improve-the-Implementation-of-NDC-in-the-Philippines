## **A Data Exploration of Greenhouse Gas Emission to Improve the Implementation of NDC in the Philippines**

**Introduction**

Climate change is happening right now, and it is widely considered to be the most serious environmental crisis that our generation has ever faced. Climate change has dramatically transformed the Earth over millennia, according to NASA. Global warming has been clearly driven by human activity since the mid-twentieth century, and it is proceeding at a millennia-long rate. Human activities have undoubtedly contributed to the warming of the atmosphere, oceans, and land, as well as extensive and fast changes in the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, and biosphere. 

Despite the fact that carbon dioxide absorbs less heat per molecule than other greenhouse gases, it is the most prevalent and stays in the atmosphere for the longest time. It lingers in the atmosphere for 300 to 100 years, and people emit more carbon dioxide each year than natural processes can remove. Global warming results from an energy imbalance caused by an increase in atmospheric gas levels. Increased smog and air pollution cause more respiratory issues or illnesses, and carbon emissions have a direct effect on humans. Not to mention the reality that people would be the ones to suffer the most if carbon emissions wiped out particular animal species, reduced agricultural output, and ruined entire ecosystems.

Philippines, despite being one of those countries who contributes less on carbon emission, implements a mitigation plan as response to climate change. According to the Finance Department, President Rodrigo R. Duterte has authorized the Philippines' first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which seeks to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 75% by 2030. NDC is part of Paris Agreement to limit global warming. The agreement was joined by 196 including Philippines, and to attain this goal the global temperature needs ot be reduced for atleast 45% by the year 2030 and reach the net-zero emission by the year 2050. Net-zero emission pledges by several countries could help to lessen the emission of greenhouse gases. Though targeting zero emission of greenhouse gas is impossible, it is better to reduce the emission into nearly zero. 49 countries has net-zero pledges it could possibl cover over 12% of global emission. Though the country's capacity to meet the NDC objective still rests on public-private sector cooperation. 

This project is conducted to provide a data analysis that could help to improve the mitigation plan in response to climate change that can be implemented in the Philippines and helps to achieve the NDC. 


**Problem Statement**

Despite the fact that the NDC's goal looks to be excessively high, the government cannot achieve it on its own. Public and commercial organizations, as well as local governments and, most importantly, each and every citizen of the country, must put up a major effort. To get the desired objectives, people must work together. The primary issue that this project addressed is the low level of participation and involvement of  the local communities and local governments, due to lack of available and sufficient information on the implementation process and measures aimed at achieving it. Monitoring progress becomes much more difficult due to the absence of information. If there is a lack of society participation, it can hinder transparency and accountability efforts by government and related monitoring mechanisms at all levels.

**Significance of the proposed project**

This research will specifically benefit the following:

Government - This research will help them to improve their implementation of mitigation plans for climate change, and make the local communities and individuals participate in the program and achieve the goal.  

Citizens - This research provides information to the Filipino citizens about the current situation of the globe and the country itself concerning greenhouse gas emission that results in climate change. For them to be aware and well informed on how they could contribute and cooperate to the government to achieve the goal.

Future Researchers â€“ The findings of this study may be utilized to help the future researchers in their future studies in relation to climate change and come up with an ideal mitigation plan for climate change that they may propose to their local community.

**Methods**

Local communities cooperation is a crucial aspect of the implementation of NDC. Data exploration will be conducted by the researcher to visualize the data and easily identify the insight of other countries' response to climate change and dig deeper into their mitigation plan to achieve the neutral greenhouse gas emission in their country. Excluded in the datasets that the researchers have, was the details of the mitigation plan of each country. In order to acquire more knowledge about how they manage to have a positive response in carbon emission, the researchers collected articles that provide adequate information about their mitigation strategies. Those countries who have achieved the net-zero emission that was shown in the dataset will be listed along with their strategies. Their plan will be evaluated and the existing mitigation strategies that the Philippine Government have implemented across the country will be compared in order to determine how to improve it.

**Expected Output**

2020 ranks as the second-hottest year on record for the planet, knocking 2019 down to third hottest, according to an analysis by NOAA scientists. NASA scientists, who conducted a separate but similar analysis, have determined that 2020 ties 2016 as the warmest year on record, sharing the first-place spot (NOAA, 2021). This research is conducted to provide an efficient exploratory of data to be utilized in order to improve the implementation of NDC in the country. Effective cooperation to meet the goals established requires good and efficient climate change governance. To minimize duplication of effort between the government and civil society, the governance system must also include a transparent distribution of tasks.

**Sustainable Development Goals**
1. GOAL 7: AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY - Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity.
2. GOAL 12: RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION - Responsible Production and Consumption
3. GOAL 13: CLIMATE ACTION - Climate change is a global challenge that affects everyone, everywhere.
4. GOAL 15: LIFE ON LAND - Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss
