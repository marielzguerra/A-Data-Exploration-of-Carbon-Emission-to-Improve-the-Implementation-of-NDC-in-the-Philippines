**Introduction**

The whole world is now standing in a pivotal point where we have just two options left: DO or DIE. Climate change is a critical thing that is happening today, and it is  clearly visible to our naked eyes as we could witness how the ice glaciers melted, how frequent hurricanes are occuring and destroy establishments and took several lives, and we can feel how Earth is getting sick. 

Recently, the world was shocked when a group of NASA scientist commits civil disobedience, promoting an environmental revolution as they see it is badly needed for the leaders of the world to take an action, and they demand to stop the burning of fossil fuels for the futre of the next generation. The amount of greenhouse gasses is dominating the atmosphere more than what we can imagine, specifically, the carbon dioxide. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2022), human activities contributes to the carbon dioxide to increase in a daily basis, such as burning fossil fuels and other biologicla materials that we could see on Erth. Global warming is occuring due to increase of temperature as the huge amount of heat was trapped in the atmosphere because of high level of concentration of the greenhouse gasses. According to Osmanski (2020), the excessive amount of carbon dioxide threathens the life of all living organisms, even the plants and trees that we know naturally takes carbom dioxide as thei food. Too much heat caused them to withered. 

Based on the article published by United Nation Climate Change (2022), the core of the Paris Agreement is the National Determined Contribution (NDC) and is the actual mitigation strategies of each country who joined the agreement with the goal of reducing greenhouse gasses emissions and respond and adopt to the effect of climate change. The administration of President Rodrigo Duterte presented the Philippine MDC, however, the aforementioned NDC lacks clarity in terms of how it would be implemented and attained. 

To provide help for the improvement of NDC implementation in the Philippines, researchers assess the carbon emission per capita of each country and the carbon concentration part per million per year and assess their mitigation plan. The gathered data will help the governement and individuals to imolement the NDC more effectively. 


**Problem Statement**

Philippine NDC lacks clarity for achieving its objective of r3ducing the emissions by 75% by 230. Accordinf to Greenpeace Philippines (2021), the proposal does not address specific and concrete policies for imolenetation in to different sectors such as transportation, waste, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors. The government is responsible for the imolementation of NDC as part of climatechange adaptation strategy, although NDC requires higher degree of the participation of each citizen, it is not clearly evident. The cooperation of each individual is also necessary, as well as the collaboration and initiatives of relevant agencies from each sectors to support the Philippine government in accomolishing the aim. 


**Significance of the proposed project**

The following will benifit from the study: 

Government -  This research will assist the governmemt in better implementation of climate change mitigation plan to ensure that engagement of local communities to the lrogram to accomolish the objectives. 

Citizens - This research informs Filipino citizens in terms of greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change and inform them on how they may help the government to achive the goal by contributing and cooperating with it. 

Future Researchers – The findings of this study may be utilized to help the future researchers in their future studies in relation to climate change and come up with an ideal mitigation plan for climate change that they may propose to their local community.


**Methods**

Cooperation among private or public sectors and local communities is critical to the imolementation of the NDC. The researchers will undertake data exploration in order to display the information and quickly uncover insights regarding other nation's responses to climate change, as well as dive deeper into their mitigation plans to reach carbon neutrality in their country. The reasearchers will also gather articles that give relevant information about country's mitigation measures in order to learn more about how they manage to have a positive response in carbon emission and other greenhouse gasses. 


**Expected Output**

According to NOAA scientist, 2020 will be the warmest year on record, matching 2016 for the first place and putting 2019 in third place. The goal of this study is to examine data in depth in order to improve the country's NDC imolementation. Effective collaboration to achieve the identified goals necessitates good and efficient climate change governance.
